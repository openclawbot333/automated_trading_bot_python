# Bearish on a Gap Up — NQ Model

## Overview
Sell short into rallies within a bearish daily framework. Counter-trend — sell WHILE price is rising into premium arrays. Do NOT use opening range breakout strategies.

## Phase I — Daily Bias (Suspension Block)
- Identify a significant daily price range defined by a volume bounce at the low and swing high at the top.
- Calculate **Consequent Encroachment (CE)** = exact 50% midpoint of the Suspension Block.
- **BEARISH bias confirmed** when price closes BELOW the CE.
- Only a sustained close above CE invalidates the bearish bias.

## Phase II — Fibonacci Gradient Levels on Daily Wicks
- Apply to each significant daily discount wick (long lower wicks where wick > 50% of candle range).
- **Quadrants:** 25% increments (0.25, 0.50, 0.75).
- **Eighths:** 12.5% increments (0.125, 0.25, 0.375, 0.50, 0.625, 0.75, 0.875).
- The 50% CE of the wick is the primary draw on liquidity.

## Phase III — SMT Divergence (NQ vs ES)
- NQ makes a **HIGHER HIGH** while ES makes a **LOWER HIGH** = bearish confirmation.
- Used as a qualifier, not a timing tool.
- Must occur at or near the Daily Suspension Block CE.

## Phase IV — Entry Rules (1-Minute Chart)
- **SHORT ONLY** (sell into rallies).
- Entry zone: price rallies UP into Fair Value Gaps (FVGs) or Daily Suspension Block CE on the 1-min chart.
- Pre-conditions: (1) Daily bias bearish, (2) SMT confirmed, (3) Price entering premium array.
- Entry trigger: price reaches FVG/CE and shows rejection (wick / failure to close above).
- Session: New York session preferred (pre-market or opening range).

## Stop Loss
- Hard stop **ABOVE** the high of the Daily Suspension Block.
- Add 5–10 points buffer above for stop hunts.
- Use 1–3 micro NQ contracts ($2/point per micro).
- Max risk: 1–2% of account equity.

## Take Profit (3-Tier Scaling)
| Tier | Allocation | Target |
|------|-----------|--------|
| TP1 | 50% | New Week Opening Gap (NWOG) — gap between Friday close and Monday open |
| TP2 | 30% | Sellside Liquidity Pools — relative equal lows / old session lows |
| TP3 | 20% (trail) | Gradient Levels — Fibonacci wick eighths/quadrants |

After TP1 hit, move stop to breakeven.

## Risk Management
- Max position: 1–3 micro NQ contracts.
- Max risk per trade: 1–2% account equity.
- Max daily loss: 3–5% — stop trading if hit.
- **Spring Filter:** if price action is too choppy (low ADX), skip trading.
- No averaging down — ever.
