# jadecap daily sweep

## Overview
Daily Sweep is a three‑step strategy: (1) mark H1 swing points (“tripwires”), (2) wait for an H1 close back in range after a sweep, (3) execute on M5 with an order‑block/breaker entry, 2R target, and time‑based risk management.

## Step 1 — Plot Swing Points (7:00–8:00 AM ET)
- Work **only on the 1H chart**.
- Mark **hourly swing points** from the previous day and the sessions leading up to 8:00 AM (Asia/London).
- **Only mark levels that have NOT been traded through** (fresh liquidity).
- If the prior day’s range is broken, **look back to the next most recent day** for fresh swing highs/lows.
- These horizontal “tripwires” are **the only places you are allowed to trade**.
- Keep this step quick: **5–10 minutes max**.

## Step 2 — Confirmation Filter (Rule of Closure)
- **No front‑running.** A sweep alone is not a trade.
- Wait for the **1H candle to close back inside the range** after sweeping a swing high/low.
- If price **breaks out and does not close back in range**, it is **invalid** → **no trade**.
- **Do not drop to lower timeframes** until the H1 close confirms the sweep.

## Step 3 — M5 Execution
- After H1 confirmation, drop to **5‑minute** chart for entry.
- **Entry model (bearish example; invert for bullish):**
  1) Break of local market structure on M5
  2) Formation of a **bearish order block**
  3) **Alignment with a breaker**
  4) **Trigger:** enter **on retest** of the order block
- **Stop‑loss options:**
  - **Aggressive:** above the M5 breaker
  - **Conservative:** above the H1 swing high (preferred in chop)
- **Target:** **2R** (2:1 reward‑to‑risk)
- **Time management:** reduce risk or take partials into the **11:00–12:00 PM** lunch window

## Risk & Limits
- **Two‑bullet rule:** max **2 attempts per day**
  - If AM fails, you may try PM
  - If PM fails, **walk away**
- **PM session adjustment (1:00–4:00 PM):** if morning was choppy or a loss, **do not trust tight M5 stops**; use **H1 stop** instead.

## Example Scenarios
- **Perfect setup:** 9:00 AM H1 candle raids a swing high and closes back in range → 9:55–10:00 AM M5 bearish order block + breaker → short to 2R.
- **Choppy morning:** first trade loses → limit to two attempts; in PM session, widen stop above H1 high.

## Notes
- Steps 1–2 are **rigid rules**; Step 3 (execution/stop selection) requires experience and repetition.
- Consistency > complexity.
